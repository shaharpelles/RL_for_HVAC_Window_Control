# Generalisation and Methodological Improvements in Reinforcement Learning for HVAC-Window Control

This repository contains the code I developed for my thesis project, as part of my MSc in AI for Sustainable Development at UCL.

It is based on a publication by Xin Liu, and Zhonghua Gou, and uses their published code notebook and data as a base.
